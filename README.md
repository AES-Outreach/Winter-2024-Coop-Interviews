# OutStem Front-end Challenge

Welcome to the OutStem front-end challenge. Submission instructions are listed below. The deadline to submit this challenge is **Monday September 25th, 9:00 AM**. We would like to emphasize that we are looking for effort, and that the challenge is just part of our discussion with you during the interview, so donâ€™t worry if your solution is *hacky* or even if it doesnâ€™t work, we want to see it!

## The Challenge

The challenge is to build a Trivia game app, where users will be given multiple choice and true/false questions of increasing difficulty.

The design and layout of the website is totally up to you (feel free to use any UI libraries), though you will be judged on the look, feel, and usability of your application, so do your best to respect best practices in web design.

For this challenge, we will be using the [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com/), which provides a list of random questions using the amount, difficulty, type, and category parameters.

## Api Documentation
For reference, here is the [link](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) to the full API docs, however this section will cover the basic information you will need to make requests

| type       | Type of question, either multiple choice or true/false | multiple, boolean                                     | type=boolean    |
| category   | Integer mapping to the category of questions           | Refer to full docs, we will use General Knowledge = 9 | category=9      |

```


## Goals
This challenge has multiple goals that increase in level of difficulty, implement as many of these goals as you are able to.


### Goal 1
Fetch an easy, **true/false**, general knowledge question from the API, and print the response to the console


### Goal 2

Instead of printing to the console, display the question to the user, and allow them to select between the true and false options using whichever UI elements you think are best suited.


### Goal 3
If the user choses the correct answer, give them a success message, and the option to move on to the next stage of the game.

If they chose the incorrect answer, give them a failure message and have them restart the game.

### Goal 4

Now fetch an easy **multiple choice** question from the general knowledge category. 

Display the question on the screen for the user, and allow them to select their answer with whichever UI elements you think are best suited 

### Goal 5

If the user choses the correct answer, give them a success message, and the option to move on to the next stage of the game.

If they chose the incorrect answer, give them a failure message and have them restart the game.

### Goal 6

Repeat with goals 1-5 with medium, and then hard questions

### Goal 7

Build a nice congratulations page for users who won your quiz game!

## Bonus Challenges
If you're done and looking for more challenges, here are some extra ideas!:

- Give the user 2 extra lives instead of ending the game on the first failure
- Add a points system for different question difficulties
- Allow the user to select different categories for the game
- Add animations!
