# OutStem Front-end Challenge

Welcome to the OutStem front-end challenge. Submission instructions are listed below. The deadline to submit this challenge is **Tuesday May 23rd, 9:00 AM**. We would like to emphasize that we are looking for effort, and that the challenge is just part of our discussion with you during the interview, so donâ€™t worry if your solution is *hacky* or even if it doesnâ€™t work, we want to see it!

## The Challenge

The challenge is to build a fun card game app, where users will be given cards from a [standard deck of playing cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_52-card_deck), and make guesses about the next card that will be drawn. 

The design and layout of the website is totally up to you (feel free to use any UI libraries), though you will be judged on the look, feel, and usability of your application, so do your best to respect best practices in web design.

For this challenge, we will be using the [Deck of Cards API](https://www.deckofcardsapi.com/), which creates a deck of cards for you, gives you a `deck_id`, and keeps track of which cards are left as you draw cards.

## Goals
This challenge has multiple goals that increase in level of difficulty, implement as many of these goals as you are able to.

### Goal 1
Fetch a new deck of cards from the API, and print the response to the console

URL: `https://www.deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/new/`

Example Response:
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "deck_id": "3p40paa87x90",
    "shuffled": false,
    "remaining": 52
}
```


### Goal 2

Ask the user if the next card will be Red or Black. You can use any input element for this, ex text input, buttons, dropdown


### Goal 3

Once they input their answer, draw a card from your deck using the API (as seen below) and check if they are correct or incorrect:

URL: `https://www.deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/YOURDECKIDHERE/draw/?count=1`

Example Response:
```json
{
    "success": true, 
    "deck_id": "kxozasf3edqu", 
    "cards": [
        {
            "code": "5S", 
            "image": "https://deckofcardsapi.com/static/img/5S.png", 
            "images": {
                          "svg": "https://deckofcardsapi.com/static/img/5S.svg", 
                          "png": "https://deckofcardsapi.com/static/img/5S.png"
                      }, 
            "value": "5", 
            "suit": "SPADES"
        }
    ], 
    "remaining": 50
}

```

### Goal 4

If the user guessed incorrectly, give them a message informing them, and then give them the option to restart the game from Goal 1 with a new deck.

If the user guessed correctly, give them a success message, and the option to move on to the next stage of the game

### Goal 5

Ask the user if the next card will be higher, lower, or equal to the first card. Again, you can use any input element for this, ex text input, buttons, dropdown.

Then repeat steps 3 & 4 (draw a card and validate)

### Goal 6

Ask the user if the next card will be Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, or Spades. 
Again, you can use any input element for this, ex text input, buttons, dropdown.

Then repeat steps 3 & 4 (draw a card and validate)

### Goal 7

Build a nice congratulations page for users who won!
